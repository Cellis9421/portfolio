# My Profile

My profile is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) (The future backbone of the internet).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

My project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Google Fonts.

## Deployed on GitHub Pages

My portfolio is exported as a static site and hosted on github pages.

To publish a new version...

- Push changes to `main`
- Build `main` with `npm run build`
- Push Build to `main`

TODO: Reconfigure deployment as a git action to automate the build step
